Exercise

## Assumptions

-   Pulling in RESTapi data when switching routes instead of storing in a cache was to enable a user to send or bookmark a link to a specific URL. If they would load in http://localhost:3000/route/901/direction/0/stop/MAAM they would be able to get the most up to date information about that stop in the future.
-   using of reactstrap library to simplify styling of the web app so i could focus on the logic of the React.js code

## How to install the app

`npm i`

## How to start the app

`npm start`

## How to run tests

`npm test`

## Questions

-   What made you pick this code?
-   Why did you choose this framework?
-   How did your solution for this problem evolve over time?
-   What was the biggest challenge related to solving this problem?

*   Testing my routes with good and bad data
*   Did not create unit tests for REST api because it should be handled by the Metro Transit system
*   Scope of testing
*   UI/UX

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
